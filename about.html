        <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>is a person’s weight in kilograms (or pounds) divided by the square of height in meters (or feet). A high BMI
          can indicate high body fatness. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it
          does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual.<br>
          Regardless of the current BMI-for-age category, help your child or teen develop healthy weight habits and talk
          with your doctor or other healthcare provider as part of ongoing tracking of BMI-for-age. If your child has
          significant weight loss or gain, he or she should be referred to and guided by a doctor or other healthcare
          provider.</p>

        <h2 a="maintain">Maintaining your Body Weight.</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Exercise often: Studies prove that people with high activity levels are more likely to maintain their weight
          loss than others who are not as active. Set exercise goals, aiming to build up to a minimum of 200-300 minutes
          of exercise per week (ACSM guidelines). Eat a healthy breakfast daily. Seventy-eight percent of participants
          in the NWCR eat breakfast every day. Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water or other no-calorie unsweetened
          beverages. Avoid sugar-sweetened beverages.
          Eat whole foods. Focus on a healthy eating pattern of whole, unprocessed foods that is rich in produce and
          fiber, contains lean protein sources, and is lower in fat.
          Eat responsibly and mindfully. Pay attention to portion sizes and avoid overeating. Look at the nutrition
          facts on food labels listed on packages, including the serving size. Using smaller plates and bowls may help
          you choose smaller portions at meals.
          Prioritize meal time. Eat slowly, with focus on your meal. Listen to your body ‘s physical cues to stop eating
          before you feel overly full. On special occasions, choose your foods as wisely as you would on any other day.
          Plan your meals ahead of time. By planning meals in advance, you can make healthier choices that are not
          influenced by physical hunger.
          Plan home-cooked meals, reserving restaurant dining for special occasions. Packing low-calorie snacks like
          fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains can help keep hunger controlled throughout the day.
          Decrease screen time. More time in front of the television or computer means less time on your feet using
          calories. Sixty-two percent of NWCR participants watch less than 10 hours of TV per week. Choose enjoyable
          activities that keep you on your feet and moving during leisure time. This movement is important in addition
          to exercise time.
          Monitor yourself. If you don’t hold yourself accountable, who will? Weigh yourself weekly, or take self
          measurements regularly; 75% of participants in the NWCR weigh themselves at least once a week. If you find
          yourself going back to old habits, try to keep a record of food and exercise for a few weeks until you get
          back on track.
          Join a weight management program. The longer and more often you are engaged, the better long-term success.
          Continue your healthy eating habits. You have done a great job to get to where you are now. Keep updating your
          goals as new situations arise.</p>
